    "# Plus Minus Player Impact Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "A common question in BBall analytics is how do we quantify the effect that a single player has on the outcome of a game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest metric to capture this is Plus-Minus (PM), which assigns to each player (per game) a value which quantifies how much the game score changed for their team when the player was on the court.  For example, if, in all of the minutes that Andre Drummond is on the court, the Lakers score 20 points but their opponents score 30 points, then Andre Drummond is assigned a PM of -10.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a major problem with this metric is that it does not consider the effects of lineups.  For example, if Andre Drummond only plays with Anthony Davis, does the -10 value really accurately capture the effect of Andre Drummond?  Or, if Andre Drummond is specifically played against a certain matchup, how does this change his contribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we correct for this?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regularized Adjusted Plus Minus\n",
    "\n",
    "One attempt to account for these effects is the Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus (RAPM) metric.  The RAPM metric directly models the fact that lineups matter when we consider the impact of a player.  However, in order to do this, we have a more complicated problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, instead of looking at the whole game for a player, we look at specific lineups within a single game.  Suppose that in a segment of the game with a fixed 10 man lineup (5 home, 5 away), the home team scores 20 points and the away team scores 30 points.  Then in this segment, commonly referred to as a stint, in a normal plus/minus system, we can say that all 5 home players earned -10 and all 5 away players earned +10.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's not the individual, but rather the lineup of ($h_1, h_2, h_3, h_4, h_5$) and ($a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5$) that collectively contributes to a score differential of -10.  A simple mathematical model for this segment can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    -10 = \\beta_{1} h_1 + \\beta_{2} h_2 + \\beta_{3} h_3 + \\beta_{4} h_4 + \\beta_{5} h_5 - \\beta_{6} a_1 - \\beta_{7} a_2 - \\beta_{8} a_3 - \\beta_{9} a_4 - \\beta_{6} a_5\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\beta$ quantifies how much player $h_1$ contributes to the collective $-10$.  Due to the inherent symmetry of the problem, where if we reversed home and away, the value would be $+10$, we assign the opposite sign for team $a$.  In practice, $h_1$ would instead be an actual player, like Andre Drummond, so every player in the league would have a unique $\\beta$ that quantifies how much they contribute.  The estimated $\\beta$ is the RAPM assigned to each player!  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimating $\\beta$\n",
    "\n",
    "For every stint over every single season, we can get a value and form a similar equation as above, filling in the players that make up that lineup.  Under this statistical model, we can estimate $\\beta$ by treating this problem as massive linear regression where every row takes the form of:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    y_j = \\sum_{i=0}^{N} \\beta_{i} x_{i,j}  a_{i,j}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where there are $N$ unique players and $x_{i,j} \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ is an binary variable where $x_{i,j} = 1$ if player $i$ takes place in the $j$-th stint and $a_{i,j} \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$ is another binary variable where $a_{i,j} = -1$ if player $i$ is part of the away team in the $j$-th stint.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to compute RAPM, we need to estiamte $\\beta$ and thus we have the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get every stint from play-by-play data\n",
    "2. Build the linear regression problem\n",
    "3. Estimate $\\beta$ using whatever method"

    "### 1. Getting Stints from PBP Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given game, we can build a collection of stints by understanding that the boundaries of a stint are governed by period starts, period ends, and substitutions.  Only in these events do lineups every change.  Using this simple logic, we can build a stint as follows:\n",

    "1. Start with a `current_lineup`\n",
    "2. Accumulate all of the plays that happen between the start of the stint and either a substitution or the period ends, compute values $y_j$\n",

    "### Estimating the $\\beta$\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can fully estimate the $\\beta$ RAPM coefficients, we need to assign each player a one-hot encoding.  Then, as the above code returns a stint as a list of 10 players that were in the game, we need to translate those 10 players according to our one-hot encoding.  Once this is done, we have a pretty standard linear regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "As there is a high-level of ambiguity in properly estimating the coefficients, especially since we care about the interpretation of the values, typical estimation is done using a regularized method such as Ridge-Regression (l2-reg).  This method encourages values of $\\beta$ to be \"small\" with the idea that no $\\beta$ should be substantially higher than others.  \n",
    "\n",
